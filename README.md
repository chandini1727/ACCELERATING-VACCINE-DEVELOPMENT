# ACCELERATING-VACCINE-DEVELOPMENT
## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a cloud-based data pipeline to support vaccine development teams by enabling efficient data storage, cleaning, transformation, and analytics. Additionally, a static website was developed to facilitate scientific collaboration, data visualization, and virtual meetings for stakeholders.

The pipeline leverages AWS services to process large volumes of vaccine-related data, perform analytics (e.g., efficacy analysis, adverse event monitoring, batch quality control), and provide interactive dashboards for real-time insights. The static website enhances collaboration by offering a user-friendly interface for scientists to view data, conduct meetings, and share findings.
